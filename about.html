							Since the mid 90's Artemis has been well known in the berry ingredient industry as "The Chokeberry People."  Not only due to our deep appreciation of this North American native "superberry" but our work to educate the food, beverage, and dietary supplement industries as to its benefits has helped to position us the aroniaberry experts.  Artemis pioneered the movement to bring aroniaberries back to the U.S. from its current growing region of Poland and eastern Europe and continues to be heavily involved with coordinating the local growing efforts. We are working hard to increase awareness about this incredibly healthy berry and see aroniaberries become a cultivated berry crop here where it all began.

							It was back in 1995 that Jan Mills, President &amp; CEO of Artemis International, made what was to become a fateful trip to Poland, consulting for a business looking to expand in that region.  It was during this trip that Jan met farmers who were having to give up their farms to private investors and businessmen who were planning to build on the land.  Speaking with the farmers she learned about the history of aronia, how it originally came from North America and why it was so popular in Poland.  Seeing that they were about to lose their aronia crops land, Jan promised them she would return, purchase some of their plants and introduce them back in the states.  About a month later Jan returned and filled 2 pallets with aronia plants to be exported to the US.

							After several rounds of paperwork submissions to the USDA for entry of the plants, the aroniaberry plants were successful imported and distributed to several universities for propagation research.  It was at this time that Artemis began offering aronia juice concentrate to popular food and beverage companies as a natural colorant.  Artemis also started collaborating with various researchers and research institutions to study some of the health benefits of aroniaberries. The research results spoke volumes about the health potential of this particular berry and Artemis International began offering aronia fruit powder and standardized extracts to the functional food and nutraceutical industry.
